# SSC Survey Analysis

For a few years, [SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) has been making annual reader surveys covering a wide range of topics, from demographic variables and political opinions to mental health and sometimes visual illusions. The surveys gain a quite large sample size, the three most recent ones ranging from 5,000 to over 8,000 responses, and I thought it would be interesting to investigate their data. Here I will host some of the data analyses and charts I've made and will keep making, mostly using R.
